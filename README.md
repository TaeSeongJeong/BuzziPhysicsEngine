# BuzziPhysicsEngine
BuzziPhysicsEngine is 3d physics engine for simulation.

This engine is based on Cyclone Engine("Game Physics Engine Development by Ian Millington", https://github.com/idmillington/cyclone-physics ) and Wild Magic Engine 5.14 Engine("https://www.geometrictools.com/ by David H. Eberly)

I'm ported Cyclone, WildMagic c++ code to c# at all to understand the overall structure of the engine and improve Readability.

This project is never easy for me, but I try to make my own world for make my house, playground, driving airplane and car etc.
and second aiming to be an easy way to start your engine development everyone.

I developed it using the Visual Studio 2012 c# and OpenTK library (OpenGL c# wapper).

The source is scheduled to be shared in January 2018.
Currently the Cyclone engine porting is ends but I'm working on Mathmatics part of Wild Magic Engine.
I plan to work porting Mathmatics part until June and then plan to work two part (Graphics, Imagics) until September.
After Wild Magic Engine porting is finished, Finally, I will be working on the test demo until November.

In Summary, 
- 2016/11/01 ~ 2017/02/15   →  Cyclone engine porting is ends. 
- 2017/02/16 ~ 2017/06/30   →  Working on Mathmatics part of Wild Magic Engine. 
- 2017/07/01 ~ 2017/09/30   →  Working on Graphics, Imagics part of Wild Magic Engine. 
- 2017/10/01 ~ 2017/12/30   →  Working on Demo application of Wild Magic Engine. 
- 2018/01/01 ~ 2018/01/30   →  Open Buzzi Physics Engine and Demo Application Source Code.

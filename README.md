# BuzziPhysicsEngine
BuzziPhysicsEngine is 3d physics engine for simulation

This engine is based on Cyclone Engine("Ian Millington, Game Physics Engine Development") and WildMagic5 Engine("David H. Eberly, https://www.geometrictools.com/)

I'm ported Cyclone, WildMagic c++ code to c # to understand the overall structure of the engine and Readability.

This project is never easy for me, but I try to make my own world and aiming to be an easy way to start your engine development.

I developed it using the Visual Studio 2012 c# and OpenTK library (OpenGL c# wapper).

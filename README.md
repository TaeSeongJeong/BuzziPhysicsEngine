# BuzziPhysicsEngine
BuzziPhysicsEngine is 3d physics engine for simulation.

This engine is based on Cyclone Engine("Game Physics Engine Development by Ian Millington", https://github.com/idmillington/cyclone-physics ) and Wild Magic Engine 5.14 Engine("https://www.geometrictools.com/ by David H. Eberly)

I'm ported Cyclone, WildMagic c++ code to c# at all to understand the overall structure of the engine and Readability.

This project is never easy for me, but I try to make my own world for make my house, playground, driving airplane and car etc.
and second aiming to be an easy way to start your engine development everyone.

I developed it using the Visual Studio 2012 c# and OpenTK library (OpenGL c# wapper).

Please feel free to contact if you have any problems with your code or if you have any questions.
Contact Email is TaeSeong Jeong (<taesunglove@daum.net>). My location is Republic of Korea.

Let me create a physical world with me.

Have a good day!
